# w3m-wiki
A collection of docs and scripts about w3m

## Introduction
I was trying to study the source code of [w3m](https://github.com/tats/w3m) browser. And it wasn't very documented so I had a littlebit of a hard time. So I decided to document what I find and I created [a fork](https://github.com/medanisjbara/w3m-expantions) replacing the old documentation with a new one I was writing as I was studying the source code and gathering information everywhere I could find online.

This repository is (as mentioned) a collection of documentations that I am writing (with information from various sources) as well as scripts I write or come accross as I am using w3m.
